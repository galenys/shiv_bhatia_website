      hi! I'm shiv, I'm a programmer based in London. I'm interested in deep learning, specifically mechanistic
      interpretability, and I'm currently exploring projects in this space. when I'm not coding or doing maths, I like
      hiking and making music.

      # these are some of the things I've worked on (the date is when I finished it):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="date">[sept 2024]</span> - came back for a second internship at Palantir, where I developed a
        version control system for AIP products.</li>
      <li><span class="date">[june 2024]</span> - graduated with a first class MEng from Imperial College London where
        I studied maths and CS, mostly geometry, quantum physics, and deep learning.</li>
      <li><span class="date">[oct 2023]</span> - spent a summer as a software engineering intern at Palantir, where I
        worked on automations for ontology entities.</li>
      <li><span class="date">[oct 2023]</span> - led computer vision on the only UK team to compete in the world finals
        of
        the European Rover Challenge 2023. we built a Mars rover prototype with a 360 degree camera on its head that was
        capable of simultaneous localisation and mapping on an uneven terrain. ranked 1st on one of the major challenges
        and 11th out of 25 global teams in the final. <a
          href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/248356/student-built-mars-rover-international-competition/">media
          coverage</a></li>
      <li><span class="date">[june 2023]</span> - built RCoin, a real time auditable stablecoin pegged to the South
        African Rand, along with my flatmates. we built a complete app and working payment platform which was designed
        to replace expensive and monopolistic payment solutions available in Eswatini. got to consult directly with the
        finance minister on the design of the platform. we were the headline presentation at the Brevan Howard crypto
        showcase 2023</li>
      <li><span class="date">[oct 2022]</span> - finished an internship at Microsoft, where I worked on adding video
        conferencing to a unified communications app.</li>
    </ul>

      # here is a graveyard of many half-finished projects and some completed ones:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/galenys/deto_x">[deto_x]</a> - a Chrome extension that lets you filter out tweets
        with a custom prompt and LLMs</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/galenys/IRSpectraToFunctionalGroupsCNN">[IR spectra CNN classifier]</a> - scraped
        a bunch of IR spectra data for organic compounds and trained a convolutional neural network to detect functional
        groups. the final model achieved an F1 score better than an average chemistry undergrad at Imperial</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/galenys/CellularSheafGenerator">[random cellular sheaf generator]</a> - often in
        computational algebraic topology, it's useful to be able to randomly generate simplicial complexes of arbitrary
        dimension in a usable format for experiments. working with researcher at Imperial I wrote a small library for
        this purpose, specifically tailored to persistent homology experiments for topological data analysis.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/galenys/csvtui">[csvtui]</a> - a small Rust app that lets you view and edit csv
        files from the terminal with Vim-like keybindings.</li>
